# kag_dodgeball
Original (for non classic version) dodgeball for KAG

# What is it?
Dodgeball was my first 'offical' kag mod, it used pre-existing gamemode rules (TDM) mixed with custom balls that killed upon getting hit.
Currently it does not work with the latest version of kag
A remaster is being planned (And can be found on my github)

# Can i use parts of this or host it?
Yeah, go for it. If you plan on hosting it, you need to fix it up first, and at least give credit.
If you want to use parts of this mod for something else, go for it.
